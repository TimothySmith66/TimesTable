# TimesTable
https://timothysmith66.github.io/TimesTable/ 
In this project I performed nested loops to dynamically create HTML with Javascript.
The use of if-else statements and a little bit of CSS allowed me to create  a neat-looking times table with no HTMl. Since I am not using HTML, I may put the script and CSS in its own respective files.
